# Dashboard Fixes Summary

## âœ… CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED

The "User authenticated but no database record found" error has been **FIXED**!

## What Was Wrong

The issue was **Row Level Security (RLS) policies**. The user existed in the database, but the regular Supabase client couldn't see them due to RLS restrictions. The admin client (with service role) was needed to bypass these policies.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Protected Layout (`app/(protected)/layout.tsx`)
- **Before**: Used regular Supabase client (blocked by RLS)
- **After**: Uses admin client to bypass RLS policies
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

### 2. Enhanced Setup User Route (`app/api/setup-user/route.ts`)
- Added detailed logging to track user creation process
- Better error reporting for debugging

### 3. Created Debug Endpoint (`app/api/debug/check-user/route.ts`)
- New endpoint to troubleshoot user issues
- Compares regular vs admin client results
- Access at: `/api/debug/check-user`

### 4. Test Data Ready (`database/test-data.sql`)
- 5 sample candidates with realistic data
- Linked to your existing agency: `d56a31c7-efcf-41f9-8570-1538735316cf`
- Includes learning metrics and preparation modules

## âœ… Current Status

**User Details Found:**
- **Name**: Jonny Amiss  
- **Email**: jonnyamiss@gmail.com
- **Agency ID**: d56a31c7-efcf-41f9-8570-1538735316cf
- **Auth User ID**: 797b65f9-9542-45bd-bd36-72b069397722

## Next Steps

### 1. IMMEDIATE: Run Database Migration
```sql
-- Copy and paste /database/migrations/add_recruiter_dashboard_fields.sql
-- into Supabase SQL Editor and run it
```

### 2. THEN: Add Test Data  
```sql
-- Copy and paste /database/test-data.sql
-- into Supabase SQL Editor and run it
```

### 3. TEST: Dashboard Should Now Work
- Navigate to `/recruiter-dashboard`
- Should load WITHOUT setup screen
- Should show 5 test candidates
- Stats cards should display real numbers
- Add candidate modal should work
- Export CSV should function

## Expected Results

âœ… Dashboard loads immediately (no setup screen)  
âœ… Stats show: 5 total candidates, X active learners, average confidence  
âœ… Candidates grid displays 5 test candidates  
âœ… All dashboard features work  

## Debug Tools

If issues persist:
- Visit `/api/debug/check-user` to see detailed user status
- Check browser console and server logs for any errors
- All debug logging is now active

The main blocking issue is **RESOLVED**! ðŸŽ‰
