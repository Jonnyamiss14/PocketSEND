# Recruiter Dashboard Setup Guide

## Overview
The recruiter dashboard has been successfully implemented for PocketSEND. This guide explains how to complete the setup.

## Database Migration Required

**IMPORTANT**: Before using the dashboard, you must run the database migration to add the required fields and functions.

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

Go to your Supabase dashboard and run the SQL script located at:
```
/database/migrations/add_recruiter_dashboard_fields.sql
```

This migration adds:
- New fields to candidates table: `learning_streak`, `total_learning_minutes`, `confidence_score`, `last_active_at`
- New tables: `preparation_modules`, `ai_conversations`  
- Database function: `get_recruiter_stats()` for dashboard statistics
- Proper RLS policies for multi-tenant security

### Step 2: Verify Setup

1. **Navigate to the dashboard**: `/recruiter-dashboard`
2. **Check authentication**: Only logged-in agency users can access
3. **Test functionality**:
   - Stats cards should display (may show 0s initially)
   - Search and filters should work
   - Add candidate modal should open and submit
   - Export CSV should work

## Features Implemented

## Technical Architecture

### File Structure
```
app/(protected)/recruiter-dashboard/
â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx                 # Main dashboard (Server Component)
â”œâ”€â”€ actions.ts              # Server Actions for mutations
â””â”€â”€ components/
    â”œâ”€â”€ stats-cards.tsx      # Real-time stats (Client Component)
    â”œâ”€â”€ candidates-grid.tsx  # Candidate list with real-time updates
    â”œâ”€â”€ candidate-card.tsx   # Individual candidate display
    â”œâ”€â”€ filters.tsx          # Search and filtering
    â”œâ”€â”€ add-candidate-modal.tsx  # New candidate form
    â””â”€â”€ export-button.tsx    # CSV export functionality
```

### Data Flow
1. **Server Component** (page.tsx) fetches initial data
2. **Client Components** add interactivity and real-time updates
3. **Server Actions** handle mutations (add/update candidates)
4. **Supabase subscriptions** provide real-time updates

### Performance Optimizations
- **Server-side rendering** for initial page load
- **Pagination** (20 candidates per page)
- **Debounced search** (500ms delay)
- **Optimistic updates** for better UX
- **Database indexes** on frequently queried fields

## Usage Instructions

### For Recruiters

4. **Add New Candidates**: Click "Add Candidate" button to register new TAs
5. **Export Data**: Use "Export CSV" to download candidate lists
6. **Track Activity**: Monitor candidate engagement with activity indicators

### Key Metrics Explained

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Dashboard shows "No candidates found"**
- Check that the database migration was applied
- Verify that candidates are linked to agencies via `candidate_agencies` table
- Ensure RLS policies are properly configured

**Stats showing 0 values**
- Run the database migration to create the `get_recruiter_stats()` function
- Check that sample data exists in the database
- Verify agency_id is correctly set in user session

**Real-time updates not working**
- Check that Supabase realtime is enabled
- Verify RLS policies allow subscriptions
- Check browser console for subscription errors

**Export CSV fails**
- Verify server actions are working
- Check that the user has proper agency permissions
- Ensure no special characters in candidate names

### Development Notes
- Uses Next.js 15 App Router
- Server Components by default, Client Components only for interactivity
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Tailwind CSS with brand colors (teal #17A398, gold #FCD34D)
- Supabase for backend with RLS for security

## Next Steps

Future enhancements could include:
1. **Bulk actions**: Select multiple candidates for bulk operations
2. **Advanced filters**: Filter by DBS status, experience level, availability
3. **Candidate profiles**: Detailed candidate pages with full history
4. **Analytics dashboard**: Deeper insights into candidate performance
5. **Messaging integration**: Direct WhatsApp messaging from dashboard
6. **Calendar integration**: Schedule interviews and placements
7. **Automated workflows**: Email notifications and follow-ups

The dashboard provides a solid foundation that can be extended with additional features as the business grows.
